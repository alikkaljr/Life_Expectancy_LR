# Life_Expectancy_LR

I have used the RFE approach in this linear regression model where you have to eliminate the features based on high p-value and high VIF(Variance Infation Factor).

NOTE:- There has been a problem with opening the file. It is advisable that you download the notebook and view the code through jupyter.

SORRY FOR INCONVENIENCE CAUSED.
